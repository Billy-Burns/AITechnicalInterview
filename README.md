```

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React. It includes components, routing, and state management. The main entry point is located in `frontend/src/index.js`, and the main application component is in `frontend/src/App.js`.

## Backend

The backend is developed in Python and serves as the API for the application. The main entry point is `backend/app.py`, which sets up the server and defines the necessary endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install the frontend dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
4. Start the backend server and the frontend application.
