# Frontend Documentation

This is the frontend part of the project, built using ReactJS. Below are the key components and files included in this directory:

## Project Structure

- **public/**
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file where the React application is rendered.
  - `favicon.ico`: The favicon for the application.

- **src/**
  - `App.js`: The main component that defines the structure and behavior of the application.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application, rendering the `App` component.
  - **components/**
    - `ExampleComponent.js`: A reusable React component for displaying specific content.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory to install the required packages.
2. **Run the Application**: Use `npm start` to start the development server. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run `npm run build`. This will generate an optimized build in the `build` directory.
